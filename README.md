# Design-of-the-Division-of-Time-Polarization-Imaging-Measurement-System
My undergraduate thesis in 2015
## Introduction
Along with the increasing demand for polarization imaging applications, as well as the development of electro-optical imaging technology, polarization imaging technologies show a wide range of prospect in biomedical, geological, space exploration and other areas. Based on the different modes of acquiring polarization images, the polarization imaging devices can be divided into division of time imaging polarization, and simultaneous imaging polarization. Based on the method of polarization imaging, this thesis designs a division of time imaging polarization imaging device which acquiring multi-angle polarization images. And base on Stokes vector, the polarization information of acquired images was analyzed by the device.

## Designing thought 
The PC controls the one-chip microcomputer to drive the motor and the circle runner with polarizing lens to rotate. After reaching the specified position, the infrared polarization image is collected from camera at the same time. Finally, the polarization degree, polarization angle and other information can be analyzed.
